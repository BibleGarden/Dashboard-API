# and Psalm mapping — is 5.0–7.8 MiB (`syn` the largest). Two caps follow:

    ~3 MB.

    Because the first page carries that corpus (5.0–7.8 MiB) on top of its
    embeddings, `limit` is clipped there to 600 rows and elsewhere to 2000, so
    that **no page exceeds ~11 MiB** on a production VM that parses it into
    Python. The clipping is in the body, not silent: `limit` echoes what was
    asked, `limit_applied` is what the page may carry, and `next_offset`
    follows `limit_applied` — walking by `next_offset` never skips a row.

    `vector` is the stored BLOB in **base64**, not a list of floats: the bytes
    are what the reader mmaps, base64 costs 33% against ~600% for JSON floats,
    and a float round-trip could not promise byte-identity. `dims` travels in
    the same row, so a decoded vector can be checked against `dims * 4` bytes.

    Refusals name their reason before anything is selected: unknown alias 404,
    unknown version 409 with `available_versions`, unreachable index database
    500 naming the database and `PUBLIC_DB_NAME`.
