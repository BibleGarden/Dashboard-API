# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Admin API — a FastAPI service for Bible Garden data management. Works with the `cep_admin` database. Used by the Dashboard and provides data for Bible-API via `GET /api/data`.

## Common Commands

### Run / Build
```bash
docker compose up -d --build                    # Start (dev mode via compose command override)
docker logs dashboard-api -f                        # View logs
docker compose down                             # Stop
```

### Tests (run inside container)
```bash
# One-time setup: create test database cep_test
docker exec dashboard-api python tests/setup_test_db.py

# Unit tests only (safe, uses mocks, no DB writes)
docker exec dashboard-api pytest tests/ -k "not integration" -v

# All tests (safe — uses test DB cep_test)
docker exec dashboard-api pytest tests/ -v

# Single test file
docker exec dashboard-api pytest tests/test_excerpt.py -v

# Single test
docker exec dashboard-api pytest tests/test_excerpt.py::test_function_name -v
```

`tests/test_data_manifest.py` (ClickUp 86cbbq5zp), `tests/test_data_index.py`
(ClickUp 86cbegwqg) and `tests/test_excerpt_alias.py` (ClickUp 86cbehfqx) are
the exception: they stub the data access and need no
database, no `API_KEY` and no admin login, so they run — and must be run —
without the suite's `conftest.py`, which requires all three. `--noconftest`
alone is not enough: `conftest.py` is also what puts `app/` on `sys.path`, so
the import path has to be supplied explicitly.

```bash
docker exec dashboard-api sh -c \
  'cd /code && PYTHONPATH=app pytest tests/test_data_manifest.py tests/test_data_index.py tests/test_excerpt_alias.py -q --noconftest'
```

`tests/` is **not** bind-mounted (only `app/` is — see `docker-compose.yml`),
so `docker exec dashboard-api pytest` runs the tests baked into the image.
To run the working tree's tests, either `docker cp tests/. dashboard-api:/code/tests`
or use a throwaway container:

```bash
docker run --rm --network mysql_default --env-file .env -e AUDIO_DIR=/tmp \
  -v "$PWD":/code -w /code dashboard-api-dashboard-api \
  sh -c 'PYTHONPATH=app pytest tests/test_data_index.py -q --noconftest'
```

The rest of the suite additionally needs `TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — the plaintext
of `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` — in the environment; it is in neither `.env` nor
`.env.example`, and without it `conftest.py`'s session-scoped `admin_token`
fixture fails every test with `401 Incorrect username or password`.

Tests run inside the `dashboard-api` container — they depend on env vars (`API_KEY`, etc.). `conftest.py` sets `DB_NAME=cep_test` before app imports, so all tests use the test database (production DB `cep_admin` is never touched). Integration tests (`test_*_integration.py`) use `TestClient` + real test DB. Unit tests use `@patch` mocks. Re-run `setup_test_db.py` after migration or seed data changes.

### Migrations
```bash
python migrate.py migrate              # Run pending migrations
python migrate.py create "name"        # Create new migration file
python migrate.py status               # Show migration status
python migrate.py mark-executed "f.sql" # Mark as already applied
```

Migration files live in `migrations/` with naming `YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_name.sql`.

### OpenAPI Spec
```bash
docker exec dashboard-api bash -c "cd /code && PYTHONPATH=app python3 extract-openapi.py app.main:app"
```

## Architecture

### Application Structure (`app/`)

- **`main.py`** — FastAPI app entry point, all admin endpoints (anomalies, translations, voices, cache), the `timed_cache` decorator, and Swagger tag ordering. Imports routers from excerpt, checks, audio, data.
- **`excerpt.py`** — Core content endpoints: `chapter_with_alignment` and `excerpt_with_alignment`. Handles verse reference parsing (e.g. "jhn 3:16-17"), audio alignment with manual fix overrides, and `lru_cache` for audio file existence checks. The `excerpt` value is `<book alias> <chapter>[:<verse>[-<verse>]]`; the book is the **catalogue alias** of `GET /api/translations/{code}/books` (`bible_books.code1..code5`), Latin, **case-insensitive** — `EXCERPT_PATTERN` takes the whole token and casefolds it, so `Gen 1:1` no longer matches the substring `en`, an unparseable value is a `422` naming the format and an unknown alias a `404`. `short_name_en`/`short_name_ru` are display names and are **not** matched by the lookup. Mirrors Bible-API exactly (ClickUp 86cbehfqx, Maria's decision of 2026-09-05; rationale in `Bible-API/architect/adding-a-language.md` 3.5). Tests: `tests/test_excerpt_alias.py`, one of the `--noconftest` files.
- **`audio.py`** — MP3 file serving with HTTP Range request support. Accepts API key via query param (for HTML `<audio>` elements that can't send headers).
- **`data.py`** — Data export for Bible-API (RequireAPIKey). `GET /api/data` returns all active data with COALESCE(manual_fixes); `GET /api/data/manifest` (2026-08-30, ClickUp 86cbbq5zp) returns the *plan* of a full resync in a few kilobytes — the reference tables, `code`+`alias` of every active translation, and expected row counts per table and per translation. Bible-API's full import walks that list one translation at a time instead of downloading the 147 MB whole export, which OOM-killed the production VM on 2026-08-30 (the export was materialised in *this* process too, on the same VM). The manifest's count predicates mirror `get_data` statement for statement — they are the input of the importer's post-import verification, so a divergence would turn it into noise. `counts.per_translation` is not decoration: the importer verifies **every translation in every table it owns**, because global totals pass on compensating errors (one translation gains a hundred verses, another loses a hundred). Two consequences for this endpoint: an active translation missing from `per_translation` makes the importer refuse the resync with 502 (an unverifiable translation is a broken source), and a translation dropped from `translations` here makes the importer refuse to delete it from `cep_public` unless the operator passes `?allow_removals=1` — deactivating a translation in `cep_admin` no longer silently removes it from production. `GET /api/data/index` (2026-09-05, ClickUp 86cbegwqg) ships the RAG index of **one** translation — `translation_chunks`, `psalm_verse_mappings` and the `chunk_embeddings` of exactly one `embedding_version` — so a resync carries the index along with the text instead of a hand-made MySQL dump over an SSH tunnel. It is the one place in this service that reads the **local `cep_public`** (`PUBLIC_DB_NAME`) across databases, the `{PUBLIC_DB_NAME}.<table>` idiom `stats.py` already uses: the index is written there by Bible-API's CLIs, and a copy in `cep_admin` would be a second source of truth that nothing rebuilds. `vector` is base64 of the stored BLOB, not a list of floats (1024 JSON floats ≈ 11 KB a row, ~44 MB a translation); `dims` travels beside it, so a decoded vector is checkable against `dims * 4` bytes. `limit`/`offset` page over the embeddings only — they are ~5.6 KB a row against ~0.7 KB for a chunk — and the corpus tables come back in full on `offset=0` and as `null` (never `[]`) on later pages. A page therefore has a **byte budget, not just a row count**: the first page carries the whole corpus (5.0–7.8 MiB) on top of its embeddings, so `limit` is clipped there to `FIRST_PAGE_EMBEDDINGS = 600` and elsewhere to `PAGE_EMBEDDINGS_MAX = 2000`, keeping every page ≈ 11 MiB against the 12 MiB the importer's 2–4 GB VM can afford to parse (uncapped, `limit=2000&offset=0` measured 18.5 MiB for `syn`). The clip is reported, not silent: `limit` echoes the request, `limit_applied` is what the page may carry, and `next_offset = offset + limit_applied`, so a walk driven by `next_offset` never skips a row (measured 2026-09-05: syn 10.96 / bsb 8.63 / ubh 10.76 MiB first page, three pages and 3963 unique embeddings for a full syn walk). Both constants are arithmetic over measured row sizes — raising one without re-measuring fails `test_the_page_caps_stay_inside_the_twelve_mebibyte_budget`. Refusals are named before any selection: unknown alias 404, unknown `embedding_version`/`chunking_version`/`mapping_version` 409 with `available_versions`, unreachable index database 500 naming the database *and* `PUBLIC_DB_NAME`. The manifest's `index` block reports the same facts as aggregates (versions, per-translation counts, and `chunks_digest` — an order-independent `BIT_XOR` of per-chunk MD5s, so the importer can compare corpora in one number instead of downloading 3963 chunks); when `cep_public` is unreadable the block carries `error` and the rest of the manifest still answers, because the text resync must not stop because the index is not there yet. BM25 is deliberately not exported: it is rebuilt in-process from the chunks. One documented exception to the `MANIFEST_COUNT_SQL` mirror rule lives here: the `index` counts and `chunks_digest` do **not** narrow by `chunking_version`/`mapping_version`, because the manifest speaks for every version at once — they equal what the export ships on its default path (no version pinned), which is the path the importer uses. `index.chunking_version` / `index.mapping_version` are `null` whenever more than one version exists, and that `null` is the signal that comparing a count against a *pinned* export is no longer meaningful. Today both are single-valued (chunking 3, mapping 1), so count and export coincide exactly. `PUBLIC_DB_NAME` is the one value interpolated into SQL rather than parameterised; `config.py` validates it as a bare SQL identifier at startup and refuses to start otherwise.
- **`content_reports.py`** — JWT-protected `GET /api/content-reports`. It reads `cep_public.ai_content_reports`, returns the newest reports first for the dashboard, and supports forward `after_id` pagination for the Telegram monitor. The migration lives in this repository because `Dashboard-API` owns the shared operational schema; `Bible-API` only inserts reports.

**The `chunks_digest` expression (Bible-API 9b must run this verbatim over its own `cep_public`):**

```sql
SELECT translation AS t,
       BIT_XOR(CONV(SUBSTRING(MD5(CONCAT_WS('\n', canonical_id, char_count,
                    COALESCE(title,''), text)),1,16),16,10)) AS digest
FROM <db>.translation_chunks
WHERE translation IN (...)
GROUP BY translation
```

XOR is commutative, so row order and the AUTO_INCREMENT `code` (which a rebuild renumbers) cannot affect it; `COALESCE(title,'')` keeps the field position that `CONCAT_WS` would otherwise drop for a NULL title, which also means a NULL title and an empty one digest alike — deliberate, since the importer may store either. Verified on MySQL 8.4.8: the string `CONV` returns is XOR'd exactly (identical to `CAST(... AS UNSIGNED)`), and the value is independent of the connection charset (same digest from a `latin1` CLI session and the app's `utf8mb4` one). The result is an **unsigned 64-bit** number and routinely exceeds 2^63 (`syn` = 18030424974330788968), so it must not be read into a signed 64-bit type.
- **`auth.py`** — Two-level auth: static API key (`X-API-Key` header) for public GET endpoints (`RequireAPIKey`), JWT Bearer tokens for admin POST/PUT/PATCH endpoints (`RequireJWT`).
- **`models.py`** — Pydantic response/request models.
- **`database.py`** — MySQL connection factory via `create_connection()`. Returns a new connection each call; callers must close it.
- **`config.py`** — Environment variable loading. `API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` are required (will raise on startup if missing).
- **`stats.py`** — JWT-protected API traffic analytics. `GET /api/stats/summary?days=N`
  uses exactly `N` calendar dates: current `[CURDATE()-(N-1), CURDATE()+1)`
  and previous `[CURDATE()-(2N-1), CURDATE()-(N-1))`. Historical dates come
  from `api_request_daily_stats`; today comes from raw `api_requests`, so the
  daily aggregate for today is deliberately excluded. Response-time averages
  in totals, previous totals, groups and top endpoints are weighted by request
  count. Current unique clients are counts of distinct keyed IP pseudonyms
  over the available raw portion (at most 14 calendar
  dates); `previous_totals.unique_ips` is `null` unless the complete previous
  interval is inside that retention (`2 * N <= 14`). Traffic groups are
  `/api/ai/*` → `ai`, other `/api/*` → `scripture`, and everything else →
  `other`. Optional `top_group=scripture|ai|other` and `top_endpoint=<substring>`
  filter only `top_endpoints`, before its ordering and limit; all other summary
  blocks remain unfiltered. `GET /api/stats/recent` supports endpoint substring,
  status class/code, HTTP method and `client_pseudonym` prefix filters. Recent
  rows expose a pseudonym, not an IP address; the storage column retains its
  historical `client_ip` name.
  `tests/test_stats.py` creates and drops its own uniquely named statistics
  schema; it reads `cep_test` only for admin authentication. Do not run
  `tests/setup_test_db.py` on a shared database: that script drops `cep_test`.
- **`checks.py`** — DB integrity check endpoints (verse counts, voice alignment validation).

### Key Patterns

**Database access** — no ORM. Raw SQL with `mysql-connector-python`. Pattern:
```python
connection = create_connection()
cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)
try:
    cursor.execute(sql, params)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    connection.commit()
finally:
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
```

**Manual fixes override alignments** — `voice_manual_fixes` table takes priority over `voice_alignments` via `COALESCE(vmf.begin, a.begin)` in excerpt SQL queries.

**Caching** — Two mechanisms: `@timed_cache(seconds=3600)` (TTL-based dict cache in `main.py`) and `@lru_cache` (for audio file checks in `excerpt.py`). Both cleared via `POST /api/cache/clear`.

**Auth dependencies** — Use `RequireAPIKey = Depends(verify_api_key)` for public endpoints, `RequireJWT = Depends(verify_jwt_token)` for admin endpoints.

**Anomaly status workflow** — `detected` -> `confirmed`/`disproved`/`corrected`/`disproved_whisper`. Status `corrected` requires `begin`/`end` timing values. Cannot revert from `corrected` to `confirmed`/`disproved`.

### Audio File Layout
```
{AUDIO_DIR}/{translation_alias}/{voice_alias}/mp3/{book_zerofill}/{chapter_zerofill}.mp3
```
Link templates in the `voices` table use placeholders: `{book_zerofill}`, `{chapter_zerofill}`, `{chapter_zerofill3}`, `{book}`, `{chapter}`, `{book_alias}`.

### Environment

Required env vars: `API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `AUDIO_DIR` (host path), `MP3_FILES_PATH` (container path). See `.env.example` for full list.

### All API routes are under `/api` prefix

Public (API Key): languages, translations, books, chapter/excerpt with alignment, audio streaming.
Admin (JWT): anomaly CRUD, manual fixes, translation/voice updates, cache clear, integrity checks.
Machine-to-machine (API Key): data export (`GET /api/data`), resync plan (`GET /api/data/manifest`) and RAG index export (`GET /api/data/index`) for Bible-API import.
